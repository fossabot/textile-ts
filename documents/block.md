# Block modifiers

Paragraphs are the default block type. In order to identify special types of text blocks, a block signature is used. Block signatures are one to three characters terminated by a period, and are placed at the beginning of a text block.


## Paragraphs

Paragraphs are separated by blank lines. Each paragraph of text is transformed into a HTML `<p> ... </p>` paragraph block.

Line breaks within paragraphs are transformed into (X)HTML line breaks `<br />`.
